# Strategic-Growth-Audit-2026-Revenue-Forecasting

**From Data Insights to Operational Excellence**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project delivers a strategic growth and profitability audit of a global e-commerce business using historical data from 2022–2025.

By combining SQL driven data engineering with Python based diagnostic and forecasting analytics, the analysis uncovers where growth creates value, where it destroys margin, and which levers must be pulled to scale profitably.

The final outcome is a data backed 2026 strategic roadmap, projecting a $1.5B revenue target, primarily driven by the Electronics category under high model confidence.

**🛠 Tech Stack**

**Data Engineering**

SQL (PostgreSQL / BigQuery)

RFM segmentation, fulfillment KPIs, country-level performance extraction

**Data Analytics**

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data wrangling and diagnostic analysis

**Data Visualization**

Plotly & Matplotlib for executive level analytical dashboards

**Forecasting & Validation**

CAGR-based revenue modeling

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for forecast reliability assessment

**📊 Key Business Insights**
1. Operational Fulfillment Crisis

Identified a systemic operational failure in Mediterranean markets (Italy & Spain), where order completion rates dropped to ~41% versus a 90% global benchmark.

High sales volume in these regions actively destroys margin due to return costs and fulfillment breakdowns.

Impact: Demand exists, but operations convert growth into losses.

2. Customer Retention & Churn Dynamics

~80% of customers churn after Month 1, creating a severe CAC recovery problem.

36% of the customer base (10,812 users) is classified as “At Risk”, representing the largest controllable revenue leakage.

Impact: Growth is front-loaded and fragile; long-term LTV is structurally constrained.

3. Marketing ROI & Efficiency

Analysis of the 2023 Global Black Friday campaign revealed a clear saturation point.

Despite increased ad spend, ROI collapsed toward breakeven, signaling diminishing marginal returns.

Impact: Scaling spend without operational and retention alignment accelerates profit erosion.

4. 2026 Revenue Forecast & Confidence

Electronics emerges as the primary growth engine with a 34.8% CAGR.

Forecast reliability is validated with low MAPE (green zone), confirming this category as a high- onfidence investment focus.

Impact: Not all growth is equal Electronics offers both scale and predictability.

**🚀 Strategic Roadmap (First 90 Days)**

Fix or Freeze

Immediately freeze performance marketing in Italy & Spain until fulfillment rates exceed 85%+.

Retention Engine

Deploy automated, personalized win back campaigns for the “At Risk” segment to protect existing customer equity.

Efficiency First

Reallocate marketing budgets from saturated, low ROI campaigns toward high CAGR, low error categories such as Electronics.
